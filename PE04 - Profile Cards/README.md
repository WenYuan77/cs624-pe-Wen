Input
The app uses a basic React Native project created in earlier exercises (HOS05 and HOS06). The user data, including name, title, and bio, are hardcoded for display in profile cards.

Process
In PE04/Part1, I added styling to show the user’s name, role, and description using text components. In PE04/Part2, I refactored the layout using flexbox to create a 6-card profile gallery. Clicking a card expands it to reveal more details, while the rest remain as thumbnails.

Output
The final app displays a grid of six profile cards. When a thumbnail is clicked, that card expands to show full content. All styles and layout techniques are based on React Native’s styling and flexbox principles.
